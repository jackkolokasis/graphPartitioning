/**
 * Helper class that is used to implement {@link SortMergeJoinExec}.
 * <p>
 * To perform an inner (outer) join, users of this class call {@link findNextInnerJoinRows()}
 * ({@link findNextOuterJoinRows()}), which returns <code>true</code> if a result has been produced and <code>false</code>
 * otherwise. If a result has been produced, then the caller may call {@link getStreamedRow} to return
 * the matching row from the streamed input and may call {@link getBufferedMatches} to return the
 * sequence of matching rows from the buffered input (in the case of an outer join, this will return
 * an empty sequence if there are no matches from the buffered input). For efficiency, both of these
 * methods return mutable objects which are re-used across calls to the <code>findNext*JoinRows()</code>
 * methods.
 * <p>
 * param:  streamedKeyGenerator a projection that produces join keys from the streamed input.
 * param:  bufferedKeyGenerator a projection that produces join keys from the buffered input.
 * param:  keyOrdering an ordering which can be used to compare join keys.
 * param:  streamedIter an input whose rows will be streamed.
 * param:  bufferedIter an input whose rows will be buffered to construct sequences of rows that
 *                     have the same join key.
