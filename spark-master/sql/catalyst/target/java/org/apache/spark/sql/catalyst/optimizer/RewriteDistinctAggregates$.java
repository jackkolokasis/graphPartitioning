/**
 * This rule rewrites an aggregate query with distinct aggregations into an expanded double
 * aggregation in which the regular aggregation expressions and every distinct clause is aggregated
 * in a separate group. The results are then combined in a second aggregate.
 * <p>
 * For example (in scala):
 * <pre><code>
 *   val data = Seq(
 *     ("a", "ca1", "cb1", 10),
 *     ("a", "ca1", "cb2", 5),
 *     ("b", "ca1", "cb1", 13))
 *     .toDF("key", "cat1", "cat2", "value")
 *   data.createOrReplaceTempView("data")
 *
 *   val agg = data.groupBy($"key")
 *     .agg(
 *       countDistinct($"cat1").as("cat1_cnt"),
 *       countDistinct($"cat2").as("cat2_cnt"),
 *       sum($"value").as("total"))
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * This translates to the following (pseudo) logical plan:
 * <pre><code>
 * Aggregate(
 *    key = ['key]
 *    functions = [COUNT(DISTINCT 'cat1),
 *                 COUNT(DISTINCT 'cat2),
 *                 sum('value)]
 *    output = ['key, 'cat1_cnt, 'cat2_cnt, 'total])
 *   LocalTableScan [...]
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * This rule rewrites this logical plan to the following (pseudo) logical plan:
 * <pre><code>
 * Aggregate(
 *    key = ['key]
 *    functions = [count(if (('gid = 1)) 'cat1 else null),
 *                 count(if (('gid = 2)) 'cat2 else null),
 *                 first(if (('gid = 0)) 'total else null) ignore nulls]
 *    output = ['key, 'cat1_cnt, 'cat2_cnt, 'total])
 *   Aggregate(
 *      key = ['key, 'cat1, 'cat2, 'gid]
 *      functions = [sum('value)]
 *      output = ['key, 'cat1, 'cat2, 'gid, 'total])
 *     Expand(
 *        projections = [('key, null, null, 0, cast('value as bigint)),
 *                       ('key, 'cat1, null, 1, null),
 *                       ('key, null, 'cat2, 2, null)]
 *        output = ['key, 'cat1, 'cat2, 'gid, 'value])
 *       LocalTableScan [...]
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * The rule does the following things here:
 * 1. Expand the data. There are three aggregation groups in this query:
 *    i. the non-distinct group;
 *    ii. the distinct 'cat1 group;
 *    iii. the distinct 'cat2 group.
 *    An expand operator is inserted to expand the child data for each group. The expand will null
 *    out all unused columns for the given group; this must be done in order to ensure correctness
 *    later on. Groups can by identified by a group id (gid) column added by the expand operator.
 * 2. De-duplicate the distinct paths and aggregate the non-aggregate path. The group by clause of
 *    this aggregate consists of the original group by clause, all the requested distinct columns
 *    and the group id. Both de-duplication of distinct column and the aggregation of the
 *    non-distinct group take advantage of the fact that we group by the group id (gid) and that we
 *    have nulled out all non-relevant columns the given group.
 * 3. Aggregating the distinct groups and combining this with the results of the non-distinct
 *    aggregation. In this step we use the group id to filter the inputs for the aggregate
 *    functions. The result of the non-distinct group are 'aggregated' by using the first operator,
 *    it might be more elegant to use the native UDAF merge mechanism for this in the future.
 * <p>
 * This rule duplicates the input data by two or more times (# distinct groups + an optional
 * non-distinct group). This will put quite a bit of memory pressure of the used aggregate and
 * exchange operators. Keeping the number of distinct groups as low a possible should be priority,
 * we could improve this in the current rule by applying more advanced expression canonicalization
 * techniques.
