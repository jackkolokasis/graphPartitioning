/**
 * The NettyRpcEnv version of RpcEndpointRef.
 * <p>
 * This class behaves differently depending on where it's created. On the node that "owns" the
 * RpcEndpoint, it's a simple wrapper around the RpcEndpointAddress instance.
 * <p>
 * On other machines that receive a serialized version of the reference, the behavior changes. The
 * instance will keep track of the TransportClient that sent the reference, so that messages
 * to the endpoint are sent over the client connection, instead of needing a new connection to
 * be opened.
 * <p>
 * The RpcAddress of this ref can be null; what that means is that the ref can only be used through
 * a client connection, since the process hosting the endpoint is not listening for incoming
 * connections. These refs should not be shared with 3rd parties, since they will not be able to
 * send messages to the endpoint.
 * <p>
 * param:  conf Spark configuration.
 * param:  endpointAddress The address where the endpoint is listening.
 * param:  nettyEnv The RpcEnv associated with this ref.
